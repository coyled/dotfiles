Alright... this is a bit of an unconventional way of introducing myself, but I'm 
failing at conventional means so why not try something different?

My name is Doug, and I'm a software developer in Raleigh/Durham, North Carolina.
Last month, I quit my 9-to-5 corporate gig to join up with a friend to start
a new company.  We are building an on-call management platform that seeks to
make being on-call a much better experience.  For most people, on-call duty
really sucks, and we've got some ideas on how we can meaningfully reduce the pain.

So, why am I trying to contact you?  Well, one of the names we're interested
in using for our service is "OnCaller."  We found some old whois records that
tell us the admin email for oncaller.com was at one time dns@coyled.com.
Visiting https://coyled.com redirects to https://davecoyle.com, which in turn
links to your github account.  I'm hoping that you are indeed the owner
of the oncaller.com domain.  Further, I'm hoping you'd entertain a conversation
about selling it to us.

I've previously attempted to email dns@coyled.com, and dave@coyled.com without
any success.  The next best idea I had for reaching you was this github pull
request.  Hopefully, it's not too much of an intrusion.  I certainly don't expect 
that you'll merge it, but I'm hoping you might reply with a comment, or shoot me 
an email at doug@caricalabs.com to let me know.

Thanks!
Doug Neumann
